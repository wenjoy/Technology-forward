Firstly, thank you for your interview. 

My name is xiewenjun. I live in Chengdu, Sichuan province. I’ve graduated from Chongqing University and my major is energy.  I worked in a power plant for about one year after graduated. Then I quit the job. Because I find that I’m very interested in program. I taught myself programing for 6 months and then I got my first job as a frontend engineer at a startup company which has about 20 guys. I used jquery and extjs at this company.

I worked at this startup company about one year until it delayed my wages. So I have to find another job. And lucky for me, I got an opportunity as a frontend engineer at a company, business of which is to provide entertainment services to passengers.

That system consists of two parts. one is a webapp, the other is a nodejs server.My responsibilities include frontend and backend. I used backbone and react and nodejs in this company. I really enjoy the work at this company because I’ve got many friends at this company and I’ve learnt a lot from my colleagues to become a professional software engineer.

Two years later, I left this company because the company's capital chain is broken.

I got an software engineer job soon at an americ corporation called activenetwork which is a global company, headquartered in Dallas.Its main business is sports events such as marathons. I've been with this company for a long time until last year. At active I went through 4 projects. 

The first one is galaxy, an complex ERP system developed by emberjs

The second is facility, an webapp to schedule facility developed by react

the Third one is POS app, an native app developed by react native

The last one is Payment manage, an webapp to complete payment for citizen， developed by react.

I left active because I was indirectly affected by layoffs.

Now I work at a chinese company as a frontend engineer. My current project is developing an ordering system including  a browser extension and a manage system developed by react. 

I want to leave this company because it has too much overtime.

That’s about me. Thank you for giving me this chance.
